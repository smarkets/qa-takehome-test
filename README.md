# Smarkets' QA Engineering take-home test

Welcome to the take-home test for the QA Engineering application! The objective of this test is to outline your skills in the following areas of expertise:

- Knowledge of the front-end ecosystem: React/React-Native, Javascript
- Ability to integrate and write tests for a front-end system (especially React-Native mobile apps)
- Ability to explore user journeys and the code to identify issues, errors, flaws and bugs
- General ability to evaluate software quality

### Instructions

The project provided here is a small React-Native app, bootstrapped with [Expo](https://expo.io/), which contains a simple sign-up flow.

Your task is to go over this project and evaluate quality by exploring the app, the code, and integrate tests. You are free to justify the types of tests you are integrating, and how they improve quality assurance for the product, but please note that we are hoping to see the following:

- End-to-end Mobile Automation - Android/iOS App

NOTE - This is not a web app , its react-native android/ios app.

It is recommended for you to write down how you approached the problem, why you chose specific technologies, and more generally how you are solving the concern of software quality. Please also report any bug/issue you find in the app and if possible, the code.

We are also interested in any comments or thoughts on how you would expand your solution to a production system (continuous integration, development cycles, etc).

### Getting started

To run the app:

- Install node dependencies: `yarn`
- Make sure to have [expo-cli](https://docs.expo.io/workflow/expo-cli/) installed
- Start the app: `yarn start`

This will open a web page in your browser from which you need run the app on an emulator or on your own device with the Expo client by scanning the QR code in it. More information can be found in Expo documentation.

Good luck!
